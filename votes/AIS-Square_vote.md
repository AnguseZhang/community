# A Vote for New Projects: AIS-Square

## Proposal

The development of scientific computing has been rapidly boosted by machine learning and other methods in the past few years.
Recent methods, such as [DPA-1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08236), has brought us to a new stage, where approaches in Computer Vision (CV) or Natural Language Processing (NLP), 
such as pre-training, fine-tuning or transfer learning, can be directly utilized in scientific modeling. 
This will save huge computational cost for model training and obtain more unified models, being the future of scientific computing.
Here we come to a point where an easy-to-use, quickly-updated and unified platform is needed for gathering 
the existing datasets, trained models or workflows to amplify this trend, similar to [Hugging Face website](https://huggingface.co/) in NLP field. 

Here we propose AIS-Square, a unified platform for users to download/upload the datasets, models or workflows for scientific computing.
*AI* stands for both *ab initio* and Artificial Intelligence here, thus we use *S*, second power or square, for this pun. 
On the other hand, *Square* also means this unified platform gathering wisdom and sharing contributions. 
This repo will be the backend for AIS-Square website, storing items information (README and download links) uploaded by contributors.
And the website will be updated according to this repo in minutes. 
A standard PR format will be added in this repo, so maintainers can review each item before it appears on the website.

Little spark, deep flame!

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 3 days unless there is an objection.ï¼ˆBecause a website depends on this repo is very urgent, so we change the vote time )

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.
