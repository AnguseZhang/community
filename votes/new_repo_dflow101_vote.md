# A Vote for New Repo: dflow101

## Proposal

[Dflow](https://github.com/deepmodeling/dflow) is a Python framework for constructing scientific computing workflows (e.g. concurrent learning workflows) employing Argo Workflows as the workflow engine.

After first release of dflow, there already have some dflow projects. In order to show all dflow projects and make dflow more popular, I suggest to make a new repo "dflow101".

Most dflow101 projects are not stored in this repo, however, this repo maintain links to each projects.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection.

## Scope

TOC MEMBERS.

## Result
