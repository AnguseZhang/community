# A vote for community Logo: DP-GEN
 
## Proposal
As software that generates a deep learning-based model of interatomic potential energy and force field, DP-GEN can automatically prepare scripts, maintain job queues on HPC machines (High-Performance Cluster), and analyze results. Version v0.11.0 of DP-GEN was also updated last month. We have designed a logo for DP-GEN. Here is the latest version of it. Please determine whether you agree to use it.
