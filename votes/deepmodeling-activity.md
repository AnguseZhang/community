# A Vote for New DeepModeling-Activity Organization

## Proposal

In recent month, deepmodeling community have made lots of activities such as Colombo-Academy, Tutorials, Hackthon etc.
For convenience, most activities have repo in [deepmodeling github](https://github.com/deepmodeling). Such as [AIP-chapter-tutorial](https://github.com/deepmodeling/AIP-chapter-tutorial). 

There will be more and more activities, if each activity have a repo, the deepmodeling organization will have too many repos.

As a result, I suggest to make a new organizaition: [deepmodeling-activity](https://github.com/deepmodeling-activity).
All activities materials can be put into this organization( Create activity repo )

Because Hackthon will open in 2 days, so I have opened this organization. If any one disagree, we will close this organization after Hackthon.

## Deadline

The vote will be open for at least 6 days unless there is an objection or not enough votes.

## Scope

TOC members

## Result

Approved by HanWang.
